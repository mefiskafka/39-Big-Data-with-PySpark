Understanding SparkContext
A SparkContext represents the entry point to Spark functionality. It's like a key to your car. When we run any Spark application, a driver program starts, which has the main function and your SparkContext gets initiated here. PySpark automatically creates a SparkContext for you in the PySpark shell (so you don't have to create it by yourself) and is exposed via a variable sc.

In this simple exercise, you'll find out the attributes of the SparkContext in your PySpark shell which you'll be using for the rest of the course.
